"Currently Richard Starmans (Utrecht University and Tilburg University, the Netherlands) and I are working on a new Philosophy of Statistics and Data Science from the perspective of Targeted Learning (including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation,  Super Learner and Highly Adaptive Lasso).

The project takes a historical-philosophical stance and will be rooted in state-of-the-art statistical research, the history of statistics, and more generally in the philosophy of science. It covers such topics as the crisis in data-analytic practice, the reconciliation between statistical learning and machine learning, and the many faces of causal inference. 

In accordance with an ancient and respectable philosophical tradition the project will involve several dialogues, and we here present you with our "pilot", entitled "LASSO and beyond...Highly Adaptive  LASSO".
